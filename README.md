# Complete_data_analysis_package
The aim of this code is to perform initial data exploration, data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization in a straightforward manner using Python and its various libraries.
1. A set of libraries necessary for data processing and analysis, as well as data visualization, were defined.
2. A tkinter window was created to choose a data file from any source.
3. A set of functions was defined to read data, infer column types, find duplicate values, handle missing values, and check for outliers.
4. The mentioned functions were executed on the imported data.
5. Numeric data was transformed using three methods: Standardization, Min-Max Scaling, and Normalization.
6. Data visualizations, including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and a heatmap of correlation coefficients, were plotted before and after processing.
7. User interaction was implemented to select variables for Label Encoding, and the encoding was performed.
8. Missing values were handled using various strategies such as mean, median, or mode imputation.
9. Outliers in numeric data were treated using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
10. Numeric data was transformed using three different scaling methods.
11. Data visualizations were plotted after processing.
